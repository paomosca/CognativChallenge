## About

## Required tasks

* Run the app correctly on both iOS & Android environment
* Install react-navigation
* Configure the navigation to support List of recipes (Home) -> Recipe details (Details), navigating one to the other
* Re-write the 2 class component (Home & Details) as functional components and move the lifecycle logic to appropriates hooks (if needed)
* Re-organize the code of the 2 screens in a more appropriate and readable way, following YOUR OWN criteria.
* Connect to the api: https://virated-api.herokuapp.com/recipes for recipes and https://virated-api.herokuapp.com/recipes?recommended=1 for recommended dishes instead of the fake data (for example using axios)

## Nice to have

* Convert the JS files to TypeScript and create the correct interfaces
* Write down some unit tests to achieve coding coverage > 70%
